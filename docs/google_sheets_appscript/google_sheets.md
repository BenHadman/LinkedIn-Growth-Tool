## Google Sheets

Google Sheet is a free browser-based spreadsheet tool that many marketers use for routine data tasks.
The popularity, ease-of-use and power of the tool makes it a natural candidate to utilise for extending the functionality of LinkedIn Ads.

## Appscript

Appscript is the programming language and 'code layer' to Sheets. It allows you to connect Sheets to external services (like LinkedIn Ads) and perform advanced function with data.
The programming language is essentially javascript with a few querks.
You do not need to be able to programme in javascript but if you do please consider contributing to the LIGE open-source project.

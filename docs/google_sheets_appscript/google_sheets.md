## Google Sheets

Google Sheet is a free browser-based spreadsheet tool that many marketers use for routine data tasks.
The popularity, ease-of-use and power of the tool makes it a natural candidate to utilise for extending the functionality of LinkedIn Ads.
you can perform tasks within LinkedIn Ads simply by calling a spreadsheet function. For example type this into a cell: =LIBidAdjust(campaignId,"13.2") and you will have adjusted the bid of a campaign to Â£/\$13.2.

## Appscript

Appscript is the programming language and 'code layer' to Sheets. If you're more used to Microsoft Excel then AppScipt is the equivalent to that heinous VBA Developer tab that you open up when standard functions don't quite perform the task you want. Importantly for us it allows you to connect Sheets to external services and perform advanced functions/manipulations with data.
The programming language is essentially javascript with a few querks.
You do not need to be able to programme in javascript but if you do please consider contributing to the LIGE open-source project.
